## Empire Tours

[empire.dchevalier.io](https://empire.dchevalier.io)

A responsive, single-page website developed for my personal site and its based around a fictional tour company called Empire Tours. The site was developed for an introduction to Sass / SCSS while also working within a larger and scalable component based folder architecture. I utilized NPM for a simple build process that would compile my scss files, concatenate other css files and run autoprefixer on my finished code for fallbacks on older systems.
